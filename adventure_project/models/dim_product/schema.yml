    description: "The 'dim_product' model is a dimensional model that provides
      detailed information about the products. It includes the product's unique
      identifier, product number, name, associated category and subcategory IDs
      and names, unit of measure code and name, standard cost, and the date of
      the last update. The data for this model is sourced from four different
      tables in the 'adventureworks_dev' database: 'product', 'productcategory',
      'productsubcategory', and 'unitmeasure'. The model uses left joins to
      connect the 'product' table with the 'productsubcategory',
      'productcategory', and 'unitmeasure' tables based on the
      'productsubcategoryid' and 'weightunitmeasurecode' fields."
